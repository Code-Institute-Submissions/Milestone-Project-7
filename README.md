Milestone Project 

Name of Project: Jackie Summerfield Ceramics (website)

I have been asked to design a website to showcase ceramic artwork for Sculptor Jackie Summerfield. This is an exciting project which will expand my skills as a web developer. Jackie needs an online central hub that displays her work that also links to her social media. This is a marketing decision that will turn her followers into potential clients. The goal is to develop a  professional looking, clean designed, easy to navigate portfolio site that will provide potential clients with an overview of her talents and a way to contact her for commissions. 


UX Centered Design Prep

Features


Home Page - The home page consists of a large call to action section that loads up first. It has a button that links to the gallery pages. Below that there is a carousel which showcases some of my clients work. I used bootstrap javascript to create this section. When you scroll to the bottom there is a section for Jackie's newest piece of work, a button links to the about page.

Gallery Page - To keep consistency I placed the page information (text) in the same layout along the top strip as the home page. The black area has been shortened and a smaller image to the right is added (this is the same on the gallery, page the about page, and the contact page). Below this There are four categories linking to the separate galleries. 

Individual Gallery Pages - For these galleries I used a normal bootstrap grid components with hover effects. To make the images enlarge when you click them I added a lightbox gallery using javascript found on the internet. I am still not proficient with javascript, it was a case of using W3Schools online tutorials to make this interaction work. Each picture also links to the about page via a button below the images. Therefore leading the user on a journey through the site.

About Page - Again, there is the same layout. I used bootstrap to make a timeline that shows the user the work process that Jackie uses to create her work. This adds value to the product. Another button at the bottom of the page links to the contacts page.

Contacts  Page - A simple Icon based contact info section allows people to contact Jackie using traditional means (this helps people who are less tech savvy to communicate) There is also a button in the top strip which links to a ‘contact me’ form that opens in a bootstrap modal.

The site is fully responsive.


Problem with GitHub

I accidentally deleted all my git commits for this project unfourtunatly, I am so annoyed.  I have deployed the fineshed code into a repository called 'Milestone Project' I hope this wont effect my mark too much.
